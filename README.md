# KMeans-Manual-and-Sklearn-Implementations
Implementation of KMeans clusterization algorithm in Python using Pandas, NumPy and Scikit-Learn.

Clusterizer is being tested on sklearn "toy" datasets:
- Iris plant dataset
- Wine recognition dataset
- Breast cancer wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset

Each dataset is being tested with manual/sklearn clusterizers.
